Hey, Hi!

I'm a 20 year old software developer who is passionate about Machine learning, Data analysis and manipulation as well as Game and Web-development. Under these umbrella terms you will find me working with Unity, Pytorch, Pandas and ReactJS to name a few.

Most repositories Iâ€™m working on at the moment are private.
